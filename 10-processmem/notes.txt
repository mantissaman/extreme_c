Once process is created OS allocates a dedicated portion of memory.
Memory layout of an ordinary process is divided into segments:
1. Uninitialized data segment or Block Started by Symbol (BSS)
2. Data segment
3. Text segment or Code segment
4. Stack segment
5. Heap segment

Some segments resides in executable objects (static memory layout) and some other are created in runtime(dynamic memory layout).

BSS is preallocated memory for unassgined or set to zero global vars. They never get unallocated and has static lifetime.
